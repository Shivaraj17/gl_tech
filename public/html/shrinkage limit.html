                <p>Shrinkage limit is defined as the maximum water content beyond which a reduction in the water content will not cause a decrease in the volume of the soil mass. It is the lowest water content at which the soil can still be completely saturated. Shrinkage index is the numerical difference between plastic limit and shrinkage limit. Shrinkage ratio: is defined as the ratio of a given volume change expressed as the percentage of dry volume to the corresponding change in water content above the shrinkage limit expressed as a percentage of the weight of the oven dried soil. Volumetric shrinkage (Vs) is the decrease in the volume of the soil mass, expressed as the percentage of dry volume of the soil mass, when the water content is reduced from the given percentage to the shrinkage limit. Linear shrinkage (Ls) is defined as the decrease in one dimension of the soil mass expressed as the percentage of the original dimension when water content is reduced from the given value to the shrinkage limit.</p>

            <div class="specific-content">
                <p> 1. Take a sample weighing 100g from the thoroughly mixed portion of the material passing through 425 micron IS sieve.<br>

                    2. Place about 30g of soil sample in the evaporating dish and thoroughly mix with an
                    
                    amount of distilled water in an amount sufficient to fill the soil voids completely
                    
                    and to make the soil pasty.Fill it to the shrinkage dish without entrapping air
                    
                    bubbles. Water is added slightly more than the liquid limit.<br>
                    
                    3. Determine the weight of the clean empty shrinkage dish (W1)g.<br> 4. Coat the inside of the shrinkage dish with the layer of grease or Vaseline to
                    
                    prevent the adhesion of soil to the dish.<br> 5. Place the soil paste which is equal to one third the volume of the shrinkage dish at
                    
                    the center of the dish.<br> 6. Allow the paste to flow to the edges by tapping the shrinkage dish on firm surface
                    
                    cushioned by several layers of blotting paper, rubber sheet or similar material.<br>
                    
                    7. Add an amount of soil approximately equal to the first portion and tap the shrinkage dish as before, until the paste is thoroughly compacted and all the air
                    
                    voids are brought to the surface.<br> 8. Add more soil paste and continue tapping until the shrinkage dish is completely filled and excess soil paste stands out of its edge.<br>

                    9. Strike of all the excess soil paste using straight edge and wipe off all the soil adhering to the outside of the shrinkage dish.<br>

10. Weigh immediately the shrinkage dish with the wet soil pat (W2)g.<br> 11. Allow soil pad to dry in air until the color of the pat turns from dark to light.<br>

12. Oven dry the pad in shrinkage dish to constant weight at 105 +/- 5 deg C .Cool in air.<br>

13. Record the weight of shrinkage dish and dry soil (W3)g.<br>

14. To find the volume of the wet soil pad, fill the shrinkage pit with mercury and allow it to overflow.<br>

15. Remove the excess mercury by pressing the plane glass firmly over the top shrinkage dish in such a way that the plate flushes with the top of the shrinkage

dish and no air is entrapped.<br> 16. Weigh the mercury held in the shrinkage dish to an accuracy of 0.1g (W4)g.<br>

17. Volume of wet soil pad = weight of mercury/13.6 W4/13.6 13.6 unit weight of mercury.<br>

18. To find the volume of the wet soil pad, fill the glass cup with mercury and remove excess mercury by pressing with the glass plate, with the three prongs firmly over the top of the cup.<br>

19. Carefully wipe off any mercury which is adhering to the outside of the cup.<br> 20. Place the cup filled with mercury in the evaporating dish, taking care not to spill

any mercury from the glass cup.<br> 21. Place the oven dried soil pad on the on the surface of the mercury in the glass cup.<br>

22. Then carefully push the dry soil pat under mercury by means of glass plate until the plate flushes firmly over the top of the cup.<br>

23. Collect the displaced mercury in the evaporating dish without spilling it.<br>

24. Care is taken to see that no air is entrapped under the soil pad.<br>

25. Weigh the mercury so displaced by the soil pad, accurate to 0.1g (WS)g.<br>

26. The volume of dry soil pad can be calculated by dividing the weight of displaced mercury with unit weight of mercury.

Volume of dry soil pat = Vd = displaced mercury/13.6=W5/13.6 g<br> 27. Calculate the moisture content of the soil pat as a percentage of dry weight of the

soil.

W(W2-W3)/(W3-WI) x 100 <br>28. Calculate shrinkage limit as

WsW-[(VI-Vd) y w/ Wd] x 100<br>

29. Shrinkage ratio (R) = Wd/Vd=(W3-WI)/Vd = [(VI-Vd)/Vd x 100]/W-Ws<br>

30. Volumetric shrinkage (Vs) = (W- Ws) SR.<br>

31. Linear shrinkage (Ls)=100[1-(100/Vs+100)^1/3]
